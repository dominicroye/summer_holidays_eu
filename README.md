This repository contains a curated dataset of summer school holidays across European countries for the year 2025.

While I’ve aimed for accuracy, please note that minor discrepancies may still exist.


🌍 Coverage
The dataset currently includes entries for several European countries. Regional variations (e.g. federal states, autonomous communities) are noted where applicable.
